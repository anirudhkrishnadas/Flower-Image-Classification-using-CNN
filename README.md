# Flower-Image-Classification-using-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, specifically designed to classify images into 17 different categories, corresponding to the classes in the 17 Category Flower Dataset. Below is a detailed breakdown of the model architecture:

The model starts with three convolutional layers with increasing filters (32, 64, 128) to extract features, each followed by a max-pooling layer to reduce spatial dimensions. After flattening, two fully connected layers with ReLU activation and L2 regularization learn complex patterns, while dropout layers help prevent overfitting. Finally, a softmax-activated output layer provides class probabilities. EarlyStopping has been also used to monitor validaiton loss and control the training.

This project utilizes a modified  [17 Category Flower Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/index.html) provided by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford.

Their paper can be read here: Nilsback, M. E., & Zisserman, A. (2008). "Automated Flower Classification over a Large Number of Classes." In *Proceedings of the Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing*.


The best model I have found is a training accuracy of 71% and a test accuracy of 62 %. There is some overfitting but it could be because I have downsized the dataset.

Decide how you want others to use your code. Are you okay with others using it for free? Do you want to allow modifications? Do you want to require that any derivative work also be open source?
Common Open Source Licenses:

MIT License: A permissive license that allows others to use, modify, distribute, and even sublicense your code with few restrictions. It's often used for academic and open-source projects.
Apache License 2.0: Similar to the MIT License but with additional provisions regarding patents. It's also permissive and allows for broad usage.
GNU General Public License (GPL): A copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code, or any derivative works, to release their code under the same license. This ensures that all modifications remain open source.
Creative Commons Licenses (CC): If your work is more of a project or involves creative content rather than just code, a Creative Commons license might be more appropriate.
Educational Use:

If the work is intended for educational purposes and you want to allow others to learn from or build upon it, a permissive license like MIT or Apache might be the best choice.
Attribution and Academic Integrity:

Regardless of the license, make sure that proper attribution is given if you use or modify others' work in your project. This is especially important in an academic context.
Recommended License
For most educational and open-source projects, the MIT License is a popular choice due to its simplicity and permissiveness. It allows others to use, modify, and distribute your code with minimal restrictions while requiring attribution to the original author.

Adding a License to Your GitHub Repository
Once you decide on a license, you can add it to your GitHub repository by:

Creating a LICENSE file in the root directory of your repository.
Choosing a license template on GitHub when you create or update the repository.
Including the license name and a brief description in your README.md file.
If you’re unsure, you can also use GitHub’s license chooser to help you decide based on your specific needs.

Detailed Layer Description
Input Layer:

Input Shape: (50, 50, 3)
The model expects images of size 50x50 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).
Convolutional Layers:

Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation):
Extracts features using 32 filters of size 3x3 with ReLU activation. This layer captures low-level features like edges and textures.
MaxPooling2D (2x2):
Reduces the spatial dimensions by half, helping to down-sample the feature maps and reduce computation, focusing on the most prominent features.
Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation):
Another convolutional layer with 64 filters, further learning more complex features from the pooled feature maps.
MaxPooling2D (2x2):
Similar pooling operation to reduce the feature map size.
Conv2D (128 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation):
A third convolutional layer with 128 filters, allowing the network to learn even more detailed and complex patterns.
MaxPooling2D (2x2):
Final pooling layer to further down-sample the feature maps before the flattening process.
Flatten Layer:

Converts the 3D feature maps into a 1D vector to prepare for the fully connected layers.
Fully Connected Layers:

Dense (256 units, ReLU activation, L2 regularization):
A fully connected layer with 256 neurons, using ReLU for non-linearity. L2 regularization is applied to reduce overfitting by penalizing large weights.
Dropout (65%):
A dropout layer with a 65% dropout rate, which randomly drops 65% of the neurons during training to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
Dense (128 units, ReLU activation, L2 regularization):
A second fully connected layer with 128 neurons and L2 regularization, followed by another Dropout layer.
Dropout (65%):
Again, 65% of the neurons are randomly dropped during training to reduce overfitting.
Output Layer:

Dense (17 units, Softmax activation):
The final layer has 17 neurons, corresponding to the 17 flower categories in the dataset. Softmax activation is used to output a probability distribution over the 17 classes.
Model Summary
Convolutional Layers: The network starts with three convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (32, 64, 128). These layers help in extracting spatial features at multiple levels of abstraction.
Pooling Layers: Each convolutional layer is followed by a max-pooling layer to reduce the spatial dimensions, making the model more computationally efficient.
Fully Connected Layers: After flattening the feature maps, two dense layers with ReLU activation and L2 regularization are used for learning complex patterns, followed by Dropout layers to avoid overfitting.
Output Layer: A dense layer with softmax activation provides the final class probabilities.
This architecture is designed to balance between complexity and overfitting, with regularization techniques (L2 and Dropout) applied to enhance the model's ability to generalize to new data.

You can include this explanation in your GitHub repository to help others understand the purpose and structure of your model.

ChatGPT
The network architecture begins with three convolutional layers that have progressively increasing filter sizes (32, 64, 128), which are instrumental in extracting spatial features at multiple levels of abstraction. Each of these convolutional layers is followed by a max-pooling layer, which reduces the spatial dimensions, thereby making the model more computationally efficient. After these convolutional and pooling operations, the feature maps are flattened and passed through two fully connected layers. These dense layers use ReLU activation and L2 regularization to learn complex patterns, and they are followed by dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The model concludes with a dense output layer that utilizes softmax activation to provide the final class probabilities for classification.

overfiting ?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, the difference between your training accuracy (71%) and test accuracy (62%) suggests that your model might be overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data (the test set in this case).

Signs of Overfitting:
High training accuracy: The model has learned the details and noise in the training data, leading to high performance.
Lower test accuracy: The model doesn't perform as well on test data because it's too tailored to the training set and doesn't generalize well.
Ways to Address Overfitting:
Regularization: Increase L2 regularization or consider adding L1 regularization.
Data Augmentation: Increase the size and diversity of your training dataset by applying techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling to your images.
Reduce Model Complexity: Simplify the model by reducing the number of layers or units in dense layers.
Early Stopping: Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop when the validation performance starts to degrade.
Dropout: Although you are already using Dropout, you might consider adjusting the dropout rate or trying dropout in different layers.
By applying these strategies, you might reduce overfitting and improve your model's test accuracy.
